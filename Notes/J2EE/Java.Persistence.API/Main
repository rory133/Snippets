In previous versions of Java ee, the persistent component model was called entity Bean, or to be more precise, entity Bean CMp (Container-Managed persistence), and was associated with enterprise JavaBeans. this model of persistence lasted from J2ee 1.3 until 1.4, but was heavyweight and finally replaced by Jpa since Java ee 5. Jpa uses the term “entity” instead of “entity Bean.”

And how does JPA map objects to a database? Through metadata.
