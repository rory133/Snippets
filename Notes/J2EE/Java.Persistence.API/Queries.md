* Since JPA 2.0, an attribute can be retrieved depending on a condition (using a CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END expression). For example, instead of retrieving the price of a book, a statement can return a computation of the price (e.g., 50% discount) depending on the publisher (e.g., 50% discount on the Apress books, 20% discount for all the other books).
